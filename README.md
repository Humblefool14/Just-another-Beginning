I am just trying to work on new stuff/ rather old stuff which i am working on again. I am working on multiple things.
So, things might get a little crazy over time.
I am excited about this.
Let's do this. 

I want this to be a bootcamp. I have been working on ML,deep learning longer than i care to admit. I used to code a lot, but in 
the depression of classical coursework,I lost my touch. I am planning to code now continously for three months. Everyday, I want to code atleast for one hour and learn something new.(Vacations,not counted) Even in the days of extreme,I want to code a snippet and 
make it work. 

I don't know why i want to do this.
